# Here we are providing code examples of the most important sensors used during the Hack.

The file writeSensorValueToMultichain.py is a simple example, including also a connection to MultiChain. The example is reading the value of DS18B20 temperature sensor and writes the value to the root stream. Before publishing the value to the chain, the user has to input a key.

the following list of sensors will be available
* Temperature sensor
* Barcode Reader
* NFC Reader
* Motion Sensor
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Buzzer
* EnergyMeter

and probably some more
